#Microservices with ASP.NET Core, Docker, Angular, MongoDB, and SQL Server

Welcome to our Microservices project utilizing ASP.NET Core, Docker, Angular, MongoDB, and SQL Server to build powerful and scalable applications. This repository aims to provide guidance and insights for developers interested in building Microservices-based solutions.
Project Overview

This project demonstrates the development of a Microservices architecture, showcasing the integration of various technologies to create robust applications. It serves as a practical resource for developers seeking to understand and implement Microservices.
Key Features

    Microservices Development: Explore the creation of Microservices using ASP.NET Core and MongoDB, emphasizing scalability and performance.

    Docker Containerization: Learn how to containerize services with Docker, simplifying deployment and management.

    Security Implementation: Implement secure Microservices with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and establish role-based authorization models.

    Persistence Layers: Create persistence layers using the MongoDB driver and Entity Framework Core for MongoDB and SQL Server.

    Pagination Techniques: Discover effective data retrieval using pagination with ASP.NET 5, MongoDB, and Angular.

    Core Identity Integration: Develop Microservices for user authentication and management with Core Identity.

Microservices Architecture

Our project adheres to the Microservices architectural style, which involves building applications as a set of independently deployable services. Each service operates in its own process, communicates via lightweight mechanisms (often HTTP APIs), and handles specific business functionalities. This approach fosters flexibility and scalability.
